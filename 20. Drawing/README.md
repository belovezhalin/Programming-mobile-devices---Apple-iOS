This project explores how to create custom artwork in SwiftUI using shapes, paths, and advanced rendering techniques.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Creating custom paths and shapes
- Using `strokeBorder()` with `InsettableShape`
- Applying transforms with `CGAffineTransform`
- Adding creative borders and fills with `ImagePaint`
- Enabling **Metal rendering** with `drawingGroup()`
- Applying special effects like **blurs** and **blending**
- Animating shapes using `animatableData` and `AnimatablePair`
- Generating a **spirograph** dynamically

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings
- The difference between **Paths** and **Shapes** in SwiftUI
- Performance optimization with `drawingGroup()`
- Creating complex animations using **SwiftUIâ€™s animation system**
- Enhancing UI with custom **strokes, fills, and transformations**
