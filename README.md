# Programming-mobile-devices---Apple-iOS

This repository contains my solutions to the [Hacking with SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui) course by Paul Hudson. The course covers SwiftUI development with hands-on projects, making it a great way to learn iOS app development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each project from the course. Each project folder contains:

- **Swift files** with my implementation
- **Assets** if needed
- **README.md** with a brief description of the project and key learnings

## Getting Started

To run the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HackingWithSwiftUI.git
   ```
2. Open the desired project folder in **Xcode**.
3. Build and run the project using the **iOS Simulator**.

## Key Learnings
- SwiftUI fundamentals
- Working with `@State` and `@Binding`
- Navigation and data flow
